# PasswordGenWP

### The goal of this project was to create a random password generator that gives users a list of parameters to fufill.

## The app works by simply pressing generate password button.
## User will be prompted with the following questions:
# "How many characters would you like your password to be?"
# "Would you like special characters?"
# "Would you like lower case letters?"
# "Would you like upper case letters?"
# "Would you like numbers?"

## Based on the user input, a password generating function will use "if" and "else if" statements to pull characters from arrays and combine them with math.random into a final password array that is displayed in the display box on the page.
